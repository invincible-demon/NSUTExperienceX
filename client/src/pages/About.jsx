          Welcome to <strong>NSUTExperienceX</strong> â€“ a platform built by and for NSUTians to share real placement experiences. This project was created to help juniors learn from the interview journeys of their seniors.
        </p>

        <p>
          Seniors can post their placement stories across different categories such as technical rounds, HR interviews, and aptitude tests. These first-hand insights give juniors a clearer picture of what to expect during campus placements.
        </p>

        <p>
          Users can browse experiences by category, explore tips and company-specific strategies, and interact by liking and replying to shared stories. NSUTExperienceX aims to build a helpful, supportive space for placement preparation.
